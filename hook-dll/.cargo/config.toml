# Force static CRT linking for the hook DLL.
# Without this, Rust cdylib defaults to dynamic CRT, making the DLL
# depend on VCRUNTIME140.dll — which may not be installed on the target system.
# The main exe uses static CRT by default (bin crate type), so it runs fine,
# but the DLL fails to load with ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND (0x8007007E).
